title: Rate limits
---

When using the SDK with the [API transport](/docs/transports), requests are subject to a flat rate limit of **60 requests per minute**. This helps to ensure API stability and helps to prevent misuse of Abstract servers. Rate limits are issued on a per-token basis rather than per-client; this means that multiple clients configured to use the same token will exhaust the same rate limit.

> Rate limits can be avoided altogether by using the CLI transport. See [Transports](/docs/transports) for information.

## Managing rate limits

If an SDK client issues too many requests over a given time period, an `Abstract.RateLimitError` will be thrown that contains information that can be used to safely resume requests. The `resetsAt` property indicates the number of milliseconds until the rate limit resets.

```js
try {
  // Query all projects
  const projects = await client.projects.list();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Abstract.RateLimitError) {
    // Query all projects again
    setTimeout(() => {
      const projects = await client.projects.list();
    },
    // Wait until the rate limit resets
    error.resetsAt);
  }
}
```
