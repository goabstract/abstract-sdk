## Activities

![API][api-icon]

An activity represents a designated type of event within a project. These events can be specific to the project itself, or they can be specific to a collection, a branch, a commit, or a review within the project.

`activities.list(BranchDescriptor | OrganizationDescriptor | ProjectDescriptor, { limit?: number, offset?: number }): Promise<Activity[]>`

List the first two activities for a given project on a specific branch

```js

  projectId: "b8bf5540-6e1e-11e6-8526-2d315b6ef48f",
}, { limit: 2 });
```

## Branches

![API][api-icon]

A branch is where design work and commits happen. A branch acts as a personal workspace for contributors, we encourage branches
to be created for logical chunks of work – for example designing a new feature.

  > Note: Branches will be available through the CLI transport in the near future

## Comments

![API][api-icon]

### List all comments

  > Not yet implemented

### Retrieve a comment

  > Not yet implemented

### Create a comment

`comments.create(BranchDescriptor | CommitDescriptor | LayerDescriptor, Comment): Promise<Comment>`

Create a comment on a branch

```js
abstract.comments.create({
  projectId: "616daa90-1736-11e8-b8b0-8d1fec7aef78",
  branchId: "master"
}, {
  body: "Hello from the Abstract SDK"
});
```

Or, perhaps create an annotation on a layer…

```js
abstract.comments.create({
  projectId: "616daa90-1736-11e8-b8b0-8d1fec7aef78",
  branchId: "master",
  fileId: "51DE7CD1-ECDC-473C-B30E-62AE913743B7",
  pageId: "7D2D2599-9B3F-49BC-9F86-9D9D532F143A",
  layerId: "CA420E64-08D0-4B96-B0F7-75AA316B6A19",
  sha: "c4e5578c590f5334349b6d7f0dfd4d3882361f1a",
}, {
  body: "Hello from the Abstract SDK",
  annotation: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    x: 300,
    y: 400
  }
});
```

  > Note: It's important to ensure that the annotation bounding box is within the dimensions of the layer!


## Commits

![CLI][cli-icon] ![API][api-icon]

A commit represents a point in time – contributors can create commits in the desktop app to save their work at different stages. When loading data from the Abstract SDK you will almost always need to provide a commit `SHA`
to identify which version of the object you would like.

### The commit object

## Files

A file represents a standard file – in Abstract a file is always loaded from a specific commit `SHA`, or point in time.

## Layers

![CLI][cli-icon] ![API][api-icon]

A layer is a container for designs. In Sketch a layer usually represents an artboard however it can also be a non-contained layer floating on the page.

### List all layers


`layers.list(FileDescriptor | PageDescriptor, { limit?: number, offset?: number }): Promise<Layer[]>`

List the layers for a file at a commit

```js
abstract.layers.list({
  projectId: "616daa90-1736-11e8-b8b0-8d1fec7aef78",

  sha: "fb7e9b50da6c330fc43ffb369616f0cd1fa92cc2"
});
```

As a file can contain a lot of layers we recommend filtering by page and adding a limit…

```js
abstract.layers.list({
  projectId: "616daa90-1736-11e8-b8b0-8d1fec7aef78",
  branchId: "master",
  fileId: "51DE7CD1-ECDC-473C-B30E-62AE913743B7",

  sha: "fb7e9b50da6c330fc43ffb369616f0cd1fa92cc2"
}, {
  limit: 25,
  offset: 0
});
```

### Retrieve a layer

`layers.info(LayerDescriptor): Promise<Layer>`
