The Abstract SDK was designed to allow easy interaction with Abstract data from any environment that supports JavaScript. The SDK should work well inside desktop design tools such as Sketch, on servers, or in CI environments.

## Installation

The SDK is available as an NPM package and can be installed using a package manager like NPM or Yarn. An underlying Node.js version of `10.0.0` or higher is required.

```
npm install "abstract-sdk"
