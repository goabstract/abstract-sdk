The Abstract SDK was designed to allow easy interaction with Abstract data from any environment that supports JavaScript. The SDK should work well inside desktop design tools such as Sketch, on servers, or in CI environments.

> This SDK is a beta â€“ major revisions to available methods and their responses are still possible before a wider public launch.

## Installation

The SDK is available as an NPM package and can be installed using a package manager like NPM or Yarn.

```
npm install "abstract-sdk"
