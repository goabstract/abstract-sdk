> Important Note: This SDK is a beta â€“ we are expecting to make major revisions to the methods and responses that are available before a wider public launch.

The SDK was designed to allow interacting with both the Abstract API and the desktop CLI from a unified interface in any environment that supports JavaScript. The SDK should work well inside desktop design tools such as Sketch, on servers, or CI environments.

## Installation

The SDK is available as an NPM package and can be installed via `yarn` or `npm`.

```
yarn add abstract-sdk
```

or

```
npm install abstract-sdk
```
